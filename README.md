# Domain hCard Builder Project

## Motivation
  -Its just a front end app, no back end added.
  -Layout is responsive.
  -Layout for desktop screen was provided therefore I became the designer to design the layout for other screen sizes
  i.e. mobile, tablet.
  -As the form is filled out, the preview card is automatically gets updated incluing image.
  -SEO added.
  -Test added.
  -It was tested on latest Chrome, Safari and Firefox.

  ## Local Development

To run the app in the local development environment run the following command

```bash
npm install

npm start
```
The application will be loaded on port 3000 by default unless this port is busy. http://localhost:3000 to view it in the browser.

## `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
And the app is ready to be deployed!<br />
